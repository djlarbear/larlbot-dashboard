LOWER VARIANCE - UTSA +14.5 has 2 ways to win (lose by <14.5 or win outright)\n3. ALIGNMENT - UTSA's 84% ML confidence suggests they can win straight up\n4. RISK/REWARD - Underdog spreads historically outperform tight favorites\n5. LEARNING - Analysis shows 82% of losses were tight favorites; underdog spreads won\n\nThis decision prioritizes RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS over higher stated confidence.\nSame profit potential, but multiple paths to success (lower variance).\n    ",
