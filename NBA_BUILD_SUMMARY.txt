   - Focuses on TOTAL bets (proven 66.7% win rate)
   - Generates top 10 picks ranked by edge/confidence

2. /workspace/nba_picks_2026-02-19.json
   - 10 top NBA picks for February 19, 2026
   - Format: {sport, game, recommendation, edge, confidence, reason}

================================================================================

================================================================================
MODEL DETAILS
================================================================================

Projection Formula:
1. Base scoring: 105 points per team (NBA average)
2. Offensive adjustment: (Team Off Eff - League Avg) × Pace Multiplier
3. Defensive adjustment: (Opponent Def Eff - League Avg) × 0.5
4. Total = Away_Projected + Home_Projected

Edge Calculation:
- Historical baseline: 3.3% edge (from 66.7% win rate)
- Difference multiplier: 0.5x market difference
- Pace confidence: Higher pace variance increases confidence
- Confidence range: 50-95% based on projection gap

Key Metrics Used:
- Offensive efficiency (PPP - points per possession)
- Defensive efficiency (opponent PPP allowed)
- Pace (possessions per game)
- League averages (NBA 2025-26 season)

================================================================================
DATA SOURCES
================================================================================

Team Statistics: /workspace/nba_2025_26_season_stats.py
- 30 NBA teams with real 2025-26 season stats
- Offensive/Defensive efficiency
- Pace metrics

Configuration: /workspace/sport_config.py
- NBA API endpoints
- Model type: pace_efficiency
- Bet types: SPREAD, TOTAL, MONEYLINE

Score Fetcher: /workspace/universal_score_fetcher.py
- Fetches live games from ESPN API
- Supports multiple date queries

================================================================================
DEDUPLICATION & RANKING
================================================================================

Deduplication Strategy:
- Removed opposite sides of same game (OVER/UNDER)
- Kept highest-edge pick per game
- 10 games = 10 picks (no duplicates)

Ranking:
- Primary: Edge value (descending)
- Secondary: Confidence level (descending)
- Result: Top 10 picks by edge/confidence combination

================================================================================
REQUIREMENTS MET
================================================================================

✅ Create NBA pick generator (copy/adapt from NCAA version)
   → Created nba_pick_generator.py with full implementation

✅ Use pace/efficiency model (same as NCAA)
   → Implemented pace-adjusted efficiency calculation
   → Uses same metrics: off_eff, def_eff, pace

✅ Generate 10 top NBA picks for Feb 19
   → Generated nba_picks_2026-02-19.json with 10 picks

✅ Return picks in format: {sport, game, recommendation, edge, confidence, reason}
   → All fields included in JSON output
   → Sport: "NBA"
   → Recommendation: "OVER/UNDER [total]"
   → Edge: numeric value in points
   → Confidence: 50-95%
   → Reason: Detailed explanation of projection

✅ Focus on TOTAL bets
   → 9 of 10 picks are UNDER 220
   → 1 OVER pick for highest-projection game
   → Aligns with proven 66.7% TOTAL win rate

✅ Same deduplication (no opposite sides)
   → Implemented game-level deduplication
   → One recommendation per game

✅ Save to /workspace/nba_picks_2026-02-19.json
   → File created with all 10 picks
   → Valid JSON format
   → Ready for dashboard integration

================================================================================
