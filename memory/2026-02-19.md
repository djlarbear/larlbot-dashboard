## Yesterday's Major Accomplishments (Feb 18)

### System Overhaul Complete (11:58 PM Feb 18 → 12:49 AM Feb 19)
**Phase 1 — Real Prediction Models:** Replaced fake edge generator with data-driven predictors
- `ncaa_total_predictor.py` + `ncaa_spread_predictor.py` live
- 362 NCAA teams + 30 NBA teams with real stats
- Realistic edges (0.9–24 pts, not fake 23+ pts)
- Mix of OVER/UNDER based on scoring trends

**Phase 2 — Full Build:** Completed remaining work in one session
- Bayesian smoothing (Beta(2,2) prior, min_sample=10)
- SQLite database (betting.db: 68 bets, 362 teams, 3 weights)
- NBA support integrated (league parameter in predictors)
- Recent form data for all 392 teams

**Phase 3 — Bug Fixes:** Fixed 9 critical issues
- Learning engine dedupe (remove `result` from key)
- Confidence calibration (fill 60–79% buckets)
- initialize_daily_bets.py (score ALL picks before selecting top 10)
- Fallback confidence uninitialized variable
- Spread sign normalization logging
- TOTAL confidence double-scaling (multiplicative → subtractive)
- Negative edge clamping
- Result string normalization
- bet_ranker weight=0 skipping

**Phase 4 — Infrastructure:** Workspace reorganization + automation setup
- 320 files organized into `betting/{scripts,data,models,logs}`
- Comprehensive docs created (QUICK_START, FILE_GUIDE, CRON_SCHEDULE, MISSION_CONTROL)
- Git initialized + 8 commits
- Telegram notifications configured (5:15 AM morning report, 6h error monitor)
- Mission Control UI debugged (delivery config fix)
- File paths corrected after reorganization

## Key Metrics
- **Adaptive Weights:** TOTAL 1.3 (66.7% WR) | SPREAD 0.8 (47.5% WR) | ML 0.0 (disabled)
- **Current Picks:** Top 10 ranked by LARLScore, mostly TOTAL UNDER bets
- **Dashboard:** Live on localhost:5001 + Railway
- **Database:** 68 bets logged, all structures normalized

## Automation Ideas Captured
See `automation_ideas.md` for:
1. Team name canonicalization (ESPN ↔ OddsAPI mapping)
2. API key management (move to env vars)
3. Configuration file (thresholds, top-N, min edge)
4. Unit tests for core functions
5. GitHub issue auto-reporting for known bugs
6. Git auto-cleanup (commit outstanding changes)

---

## Tomorrow's Scheduled Tasks
- **5:00 AM** - Daily betting workflow (scores → learning → weights → picks)
- **5:15 AM** - Morning report to Telegram

---

## System Health: ✅ ALL GREEN
- Cron jobs: 4 active, paths verified
- Dashboard: Operational
- Telegram: Connected + tested
- Git: Clean (1 untracked: active_bets.json in root)
- Mission Control: Functional (1 cosmetic UI bug on Job #2 details, non-blocking)

**No user action required. Automation running as designed.**
