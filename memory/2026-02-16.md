## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS FINALIZED

**CEO Model (Jarvis ⚙️):**
- Main agent orchestrates all work
- Dispatches focused tasks to specialists (30-90s max execution time)
- Receives results, reports back to Larry
- Makes architectural decisions autonomously

**Specialist Agents (3 Persistent):**
1. **Pixel 👨‍💻** (Frontend) - UI features, Mission Control tabs, dashboards
2. **Logic 🧠** (Backend) - API endpoints, cron endpoints, data services
3. **Sword 🗡️** (Betting) - Daily picks, result tracking, learning loops

**Key Pattern - Task Decomposition:**
- Complex 90-120s tasks split into 3 focused 60-70s sub-tasks
- Result: 100% success rate vs previous timeouts
- Subagent nesting enabled: 3 levels deep, 10 children per agent
- Critical insight: Simple focused tasks always succeed; bundled complexity causes timeouts

**Rate Limiting Solution:**
- Multi-model dispatch: Haiku → Opus → Sonnet (separate buckets)
- Prevents rate limit blocking
- Proven working end-to-end

## 🎓 CRITICAL LEARNINGS

1. **Task Decomposition is Essential**
   - 90-120s complex tasks fail due to token limits
   - Break into 60-70s focused sub-tasks = 100% success
   - CEO should always split before dispatching

2. **Specialist Agent Hierarchy Works**
   - Persistent agents (Pixel, Logic, Sword) with accumulated memory
   - Faster iteration than spawning new agents each time
   - Can be given standing orders and operate autonomously

3. **Deep Learning Architecture Enables Learning Across Sessions**
   - Extended thinking (thinking: high) for all agents
   - Shared memory search (hybrid vector+text)
   - Agents reference each other's work + lessons
   - Massive productivity boost compared to stateless operation

4. **Frontend Caching is a Real Issue**
   - Added `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` headers
   - Requires server restart to fully propagate
   - Browser dev tools console shows cache headers if debugging

5. **Git Sync Strategy**
   - Sword's betting data takes priority over documentation
   - Reset to origin/main to capture latest autonomous work
   - Features stay live in running processes

---

## 🚀 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Monitor Mission Control** (When you wake up)
   - Load http://localhost:5002
   - Check all tabs: Dashboard, Cron Jobs, KanBan, Ideas
   - Verify error badges and retry buttons working

2. **Daily Operations** (Every session)
   - Check Sword's overnight picks and results
   - Monitor win rate trend (target: 75%+)
   - Review KanBan for blockers or failures
   - Any red badges = investigate and retry

3. **Maintenance** (Weekly)
   - Review Sword's learning engine output
   - Check GitHub sync status (4-hour schedule)
   - Verify cron jobs are all firing on time
