# Daily Memory - February 20, 2026

## 2:00 AM - Daily Memory Review

**Date:** Friday, Feb 20, 2026
**Context:** Cron auto-run daily review (previous session: Feb 19)

### Yesterday's Session Summary (Feb 19)

**Major Accomplishments:**
- Restored betting system to fully working state (commit 84d9291)
- Fixed critical Railway deployment issues (Streamlit detection)
- Finalized config architecture: Dockerfile, railway.toml, .dockerignore, entrypoint.sh
- System now stable: 5-5 record, 10 active picks, all APIs responding

**Critical Learnings:**
1. ✅ UI redesigns should not happen when core system is working
2. ✅ Config files (Procfile, railway.json, railway.toml, .dockerignore) MUST be in git
3. ✅ Recurring errors need permanent config fixes, not just local patches
4. ✅ Once fixed, document the solution to prevent regression

**System Health:**
- Dashboard: ✅ Working (port 5001)
- Railway: ✅ Deployed and stable
- Cron jobs: ✅ All active (Memory Review, Betting Workflow, Error Monitor)
- Betting model: ✅ 5-5 on historical top 10

### Key Insights for Future

**What Worked:**
- Reverting to known good state faster than continuing to patch
- Explicit config files prevent ambiguity in deployment
- Automation crons handle daily lifting (no manual intervention needed)

**What to Avoid:**
- UI changes during system debugging (increases risk, hides real problems)
- Config values as local-only patches (must be in git for reliability)
- Ambiguous config (Procfile + Dockerfile = confusion; pick one path)

**Next Focus:**
- Let system run stable for 1-2 weeks, monitor performance
- Then: Team name canonicalization (fixes false misses)
- Then: Configuration file for tunable parameters
- Don't redesign UI until model win rate hits 55%+
